Josue Moran is a 19 year old Mexican American artist who enjoys surrounding himself within different subcultures and genres to enrich his creativity. Born, raised, and residing in Brooklyn, New York, Josue has found himself traveling extensively throughout New York City, often interacting with local communities, such as the skater community, where he finds most of his inspiration for his street style photography. Currently, Josue can be found spending most of his time during the day at Red Hook Labs, interning as a studio assistant and attending the classes offered on the art of photography. He has worked closely with people such as David Appelson of LightBox-NY and Instagram Influencers as a personal assistant.

<h3 class="mt-5">
Born to two immigrant parents, Josue grew up around the lower working class, learning from an early age the value of a dollar and the struggles of having few people around to rely on. He incorporates this into his work by choosing the people he decides to shoot and how he shoots. The digital medium is a quick process to retrieve a photo, but Josue respects the work that the film medium requires, from choosing an emulsion, to the slowness of capturing a photo, to the development process of waiting for an image to appear. All this excites Josue, as it is a constant process that must be trusted in order to view the final work
